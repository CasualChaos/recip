## Instructions 

1. Make the pizza dough, while the dough is rising, prep your fillings, eg. Scramble eggs, cook ham/mushroom, etc. 
3. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Prep 2 baking trays. Optionally, in a large bowl mix premix filling together. 
4. Roll dough into a log and break into 8-10 equal balls. 
5. For each ball: 
	1. Roll out to a rectangle (eyeball dough to abt 3-4mm thick?)
	2. Spread filling into the centre of each rectangle, leaving an inch or so on each long edge for closing. 
	3. Cut the long sides into 1-inch diagonal strips, and fold these strips over top of the filling, alternating sides to form a braid. Pinch the ends to seal the dough.
6. In a bowl or mug, whisk together the warm water and the baking soda. Brush each roll with the baking . Sprinkle with coarse or kosher salt. 
7. Bake the rolls for 12-15 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown. When they come out of the oven, brush with the melted butter.
